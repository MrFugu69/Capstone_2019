Microscopy is an important skill for a Biologists as well as the Medical community: for example viewing protein-protein interactions, cytoskeletal dynamics, as well as cellular ion concentrations <sup>[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep20640)</sup>. During processing images are often taken in low light or short exposure which cause inherent noise <sup>[2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8327626)</sup>.
Unfortunately, noise contributions during imaging create hurdles for interpretation as well as correctly identifying valuable assets within images. There are different kinds of noise but two common forms are (*Gaussian* white nose,*salt and pepper*). Filtering techniques are used to control noise such as (*median,non-local mean,bilateral,kernal density based local outlier factor, GridLof*) approaches. Often filtering will not be the only task as hand to resolve imperfections with image clarity or resolution which complicates matters. 

Imagine using clinical imaging such as microscopy to aid in drug deveolpment. The new age of bioinformatics will hedge on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Currently, this is being brought to fruition through [Recursion Pharm](https://www.recursionpharma.com) and associated with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). The time frame to bring drugs to market averages around 10 years with a cost hundreds of millions of dollars according to Recursion Pharma.
